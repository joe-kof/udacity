## Installations:
This code runs with any Python version 3.* and requires a few installations.
You may install these libraries by executing the following statement: pip install -r requirements.txt <br/>
Numpy==2.2.0 <br/>
Pandas==2.2.3 <br/>
Sklearn==1.6.1 <br/>
Matplotlib==3.10.1 <br/>
Xlrd==2.0.1 <br/> <br/>

## Project Motivation:
Small businesses are very important to the U.S. economy and are most sensitive to economic changes. I wanted to investigate how growth and health of the U.S. economy impacted business growth at the national scale and chose to look at business applications and GDP.
